# TF-IDF Linear SVM Classification
A script by Aussie Frost. Updated on Sept 30, 2024.

## Objective
Create a multi-class classification model to classify Modes of Intervention (MoI) for CAHOOTS case narratives.

## Summary
The file '[case_narrative_classification.py](case_narrative_classification.py)' is a implementation of classifying case narratives that were processed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and Linear SVM classification. 

## Data
The dataset is a set of 200 CAHOOTS Case Narratives that have been hand-labeled with MoI classifications (behavioral, medical, both, other). Information on the occurences of these labels can be found in the output file (see Results).

## Preprocessing
The text contained in column x is preprocessed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization. In this case, the top 300 relevant features of each case are extracted in the form of a vectors that will be used for the Linear SVM classification. Additionally, English stopwords (the, and, then, etc.) are redacted as part of preprocessing. Finally, the data is split into a 50/50 train and test set.

## Classification
Classification is performed using `SKLearn.svm.LinearSVC` which is a flexible and scalable multi-class Linear SVM classifier. Regularization is set to `C=1.0` and maximum iterations is set to `max_iter=1000`. Read more about the model [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html).

## Results
The model performs at 67.0% accuracy, indicating successful multi-class classification of MoI. Model metric results are output in '[output/dummy_case_narratives_performance.log](output/dummy_case_narratives_performance.log)'.

We can understand the performance by looking at a confusion matrix:
