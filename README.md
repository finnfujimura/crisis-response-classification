# CAHOOTS Modes of Intervention Classification Analysis
A project by Aussie Frost for Rohlfs Lab, 2024. Developed in September 2024.

## Objective
The CAHOOTS organization wants us to classify their case narrative data for Modes of Intervention. In other words, we wish to classify which response-to-crisis is required for each case.
